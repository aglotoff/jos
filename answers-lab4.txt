Question 1
==========

The `MPBOOTPHYS` macro translates link addresses to absolute physical addresses to be used
during AP startup. In `boot/boot.S` link addresses are identical to load addresses, so
there is no need for such translation. But in `kern/mpentry.S`, not only are the link
addresses different from load addresses (the kernel is expected to run above KERNBASE),
but the code of `mpentry.S` is also copied to a different physical location.

Question 2
==========

While the first CPU is executing in the kernel, a user program on the second CPU may
invoke a system call, or an interrupt may be generated. In this case, the hardware
switches to the kernel stack (which happens to be the same stack the first CPU is
currently using) and starts executing the corresponding trap handler pushing its registers
onto the stack and thus corrupting the execution state of another CPU. That's why we need
a separate kernel stack for each CPU.

Question 3
==========

The pointer `e` refers to an environment in the global `envs` array, which is a part of
the kernel virtual address space, and all user environments share virtual memory mappings
above `KERNBASE`. That's why the pointer can be safely dereferences before and after the
call to `lcr3()`.

Question 4
==========

The code in `trap()` saves the contents of the trap frame that contains all envionment's
registers in `curenv->env_tf` so that they can be later restored by a call to
`env_pop_tf()`.
