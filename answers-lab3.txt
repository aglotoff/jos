Question 1
==========

By having a separate entry point for each exception/interrupt we are able to provide a
trap number which allows to identify this exception/interrupt inside `trap()`.

Question 2
==========

`softint` produces General Protection fault, because the interrupt gate for trap 14 has
DPL of 0 and doesn't allow to invoke this vector in user mode. If DPL would be set to
3, the user code would produce Page Fault (vector 14). In current implementation, the
faulting envronment would be deleted in both cases. But if we'll later add more
complicated logic for handling page faults, then software-generated traps would only
confuse the kernel code and thus shouldn't be allowed.
